This folder contains files necessary for the analysis and visualisation of from malware samples data through various scripts and their outputs. 
A brief overview of the included files is provided below.

Files and Descriptions:

SOURCE:
    -b14cde376a8a7a9d7ad34cdfd07108c132ad8be7f60c5c0a0f17b6b63eb28b49 stix.json
        STIX JSON of the sample obtained from Any.Run - this is a standard for sharing cybersecurity data.

SCRIPT:
    -CombinedScriptGraps.sh
        Bash script used to automate data preprocessing, analysis and visualization tasks.


RESULT - GRAPHS:
    -techniques_vertical_bar_chart_with_larger_font.png
        Vertical bar chart showing the frequency of techniques, formatted for readability - Visualisation 1.

    -tactics_pie_chart.png
        Pie chart showing the distribution of tactics across samples - Visualisation 2.

    -tactics_stacked_bar_by_sample_with_lines.png
        Stacked bar chart of the distribution of tactics by sample - Visualisation 3.


RESULT - JSON:
    -2022-08-29_b14c.json AND b14cde376a8a7a9d7ad34cdfd07108c132ad8be7f60c5c0a0f17b6b63eb28b49 strix_parsed.json
        Processed JSON containing all the detailed data regarding MITRE included in the sample. The json was renamed to use that name as label in the graph.

    -tactics_stacked_bar_results.json
        JSON file containing the results of the tactics analysis, including the data used to create the visualisation.

    -techniques_vertical_bar_chart_data.json
        JSON file containing the frequency of MITRE techniques across samples. 



The sample file b14cde376a8a7a9d7ad34cdfd07108c132ad8be7f60c5c0a0f17b6b63eb28b49 is included as a proof of concept to demonstrate 
how raw data from Any.Run looked before processing and analysis.





This folder includes scripts, data files, and visualisations pertaining to the network and host IOC analysis from the malware samples. An overview is below.

SOURCE:
    -b14cde376a8a7a9d7ad34cdfd07108c132ad8be7f60c5c0a0f17b6b63eb28b49 IOC.docx
        This is a sample file of the structure of data that was available from Any.Run for a given sample.

SCRIPTS:
    -IP_Detection_At_Least_In_Two.py
        Python script for detecting IP addresses that appear in at least two samples.

    -Duplicate_IP_Graph.py
        Python script for generating graph visualisation of duplicate IP addresses based on the output of all IOC frequency analysis.

RESULT - GRAPH:
    -ip_address_frequency_chart_filtered.png
        Chart visualising the frequency of filtered IP addresses.


RESULT - JSON/TEXT
    -filtered_ips.json
        Filtered IPs in JSON including the relevant IPs post-analysis excluding invalid IPs.

    -duplicate_hashes.txt
        These are duplicate hashes found in the dataset.
    


Usage:
The docx file is just a proof-of-concept example of raw data supplied by Any.Run.
Python scripts are able to be used on raw IOCs to extract, filter, and visualise data.
JSON and text files are providing results of the filtering and analysis.
PNG charts are graphical representations of results.




ContiRansomwareDetection.yara is the file that has the detection logic.

ContiRansomwareScan.ps1 is the file that allows to exclude filepaths, as well as executing the scan recursively on the files.
