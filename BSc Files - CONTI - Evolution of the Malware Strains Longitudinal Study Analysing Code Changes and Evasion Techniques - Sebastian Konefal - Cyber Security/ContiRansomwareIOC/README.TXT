        Python script for detecting IP addresses that appear in at least two samples.

    -Duplicate_IP_Graph.py
        Python script for generating graph visualisation of duplicate IP addresses based on the output of all IOC frequency analysis.

RESULT - GRAPH:
    -ip_address_frequency_chart_filtered.png
        Chart visualising the frequency of filtered IP addresses.


RESULT - JSON/TEXT
    -filtered_ips.json
        Filtered IPs in JSON including the relevant IPs post-analysis excluding invalid IPs.

    -duplicate_hashes.txt
        These are duplicate hashes found in the dataset.
    


Usage:
The docx file is just a proof-of-concept example of raw data supplied by Any.Run.
Python scripts are able to be used on raw IOCs to extract, filter, and visualise data.
JSON and text files are providing results of the filtering and analysis.
PNG charts are graphical representations of results.
